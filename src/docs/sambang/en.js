      "The City Connections Forum in Makassar discussed various pressing local urban issues, and invited a more critical point of view from participants. Led by Makassar youths and students and with support from organizations, academics, as well as activists and artists of the city, the forum explored issues such as how public space contributes to a more democratic society and dissecting the long-established citizens' political movements in the city that address those issues. Organizations and other initiatives which participated in the forum also created networking opportunities to discuss innovations, making space for further collaboration. The full-day event ended with an open stage that invited performances from local artists expressing their aspirations for the city.",
