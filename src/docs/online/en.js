      'The Urban Social Forum (USF) has provided an open and inclusive space to discuss new ideas and share knowledge as well as lessons learned; and also become a place of gathering and networking for urban activists and organizations working on urban issues in Indonesia. With various innovative efforts through the years, The USF has reached more citizens from burgeoning cities all over Indonesia, Asia, and beyond. Utilizing the latest technology platforms, we remain steadfast in our mission of decentralizing the forum and spreading the spirit of urban activism to achieve greater impact.',
  },
  "In 2020, the USF as well as the rest of the world were faced with unprecedented challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we didn't let the situation reduce the enthusiasm for urban activism. Instead, we saw it as an opportunity to set up online discussions with the support of our collaborators. Eights online public sessions have been organized on accessible platforms from May to August 2020, involving participants from various cities in Indonesia. Discussing a range of relevant urban issues, each of the sessions were organized through a video conferencing platform and are also streamed on Youtube, in collaboration with various peer organizations, community groups, and initiatives. Participants were able to join in the discussion, ask questions, and actively express their opinions through the eight online sessions.",

  'Although the space has moved online, our mission has remained. USF believes in providing a safe space for important discussions and conversations on urban issues - which is even more crucial now as the pandemic has further exposed the impact of persisting challenges, such as inclusivity and mobility. Going online has also allowed for more open conversations and diverse participants.',

  'Here, we have summarized eight online sessions below and took note of important insights which could be followed up. All the sessions are available on YouTube for you to revisit at any time!',

      'The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the intensity and patterns of citizens’ mobility as almost everyone has had to maintain physical distance from each other, work from home, and cancel trips as an effort to slow down infection rates. At the same time, limited public transportation services have encouraged some to start using bicycles when going to places nearby. Amidst these challenges, more attention needs to be placed on vulnerable groups such as women, children, and persons with disabilities and ensure they are able to carry out activities safely . In this discussion, we explored insights on mobility challenges during this unprecedented time and encouraged conversations on the vision of resilient and sustainable cities; one of the solutions include designing more facilities that are accessible by walking and cycling, and are friendly to vulnerable groups such as people with disabilities.',

      'During the months that social restrictions were put in place in Indonesia due to the pandemic, citizens initiated various efforts to mitigate the outbreak. In Kampungs, residents followed suit in limiting access to their neighborhood. Known for its high density, Kampungs face many challenges in maintaining health protocols, especially on keeping a safe distance from each other. Kampung residents are also vulnerable to the detrimental economic impacts brought on by the pandemic. Despite these challenges, Kampungs are supported by a long-established social and solidarity system which encourages various community-based efforts. This session not only discussed the challenges faced by residents in the urban kampung, but also explored what could be done with potential solutions such as community-based and cooperative small enterprises, neighborhood monitoring mechanism, and collective participation in managing social assistance from the government.',

Spaces for self-expression and creativity — which thrived in streets, public markets, coffee shops, museums, events, and various other places — have adapted into virtual forms. This 'new normal' has shifted aspirations, expression, and the collective spirit to be rebuilt on a completely different platform. Creative and art initiatives which are an important part of everyday life have transformed into online concerts, webinars, and various online events. This session discussed how citizens are transforming their acts of expression and methods of communicating their aspirations in diverse forms, individually or collectively, during this pandemic.",

      'Urban kampungs are known for its high density which makes health protocol — especially physical distancing — difficult to enact. This condition puts residents at a higher risk in the spread of COVID-19. Spatial challenges such as limited availability of clean water and sanitation facilities, put them in a more vulnerable position. This challenging condition demands us to find practical solutions from all key stakeholders. In this discussion, we elaborated on the actual challenges faced by citizens living in dense urban settings like Kampung and rethink together the vision of a more adaptive and resilient neighborhood during this time and beyond.',

Informality remains a topic that is rarely discussed in urban activism. Furthermore, using video as a medium for discussion may offer a lot of potential for social campaigns. In this session, we explored the process behind the initiative, the lessons learned, as well as the next steps necessary to spark similar collaborations with more organizations in the future.',

Furthermore, they are faced with limited access to secured jobs and economic opportunities, limited information, and health equipment during this health crisis. Lately, the focus has resided on the government and citizens efforts to adapt to this unprecedented situation, with some public activities restarting with mandatory health protocols. The forum discussed the stories and challenges faced by people with disabilities during the pandemic as well as potential solutions on how we can ensure inclusivity during and after the pandemic.',

      'Since Indonesia reported its first confirmed COVID-19 case in March 2020, various policies were enacted by the government to regulate economic activity. The informal sector has been one of the vulnerable groups most affected by the pandemic. In order to adapt and survive, these vendors have turned to their own resourcefulness and tactics. This discussion unpacked how the informal sector in Indonesia has responded to social distancing policies as well as the sector’s important contribution to the resilience of a city during the pandemic. Beyond Jakarta, the session also looked at informal sectors in other parts of the world, such as in Bangladesh.',

The forum also unpacked  how the media and community initiatives could utilize channels such as a digital platform to support the discourse, and how storytelling contributes towards the bigger endeavor of building more democratic cities.',
